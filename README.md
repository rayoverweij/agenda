# Agenda - a calendar without events

I have always been annoyed at calendar apps' insistence at creating an event for anything and everything, and often I'd think back fondly to writing and doodling anywhere in my school agendas. With nothing better to do in quarantine, I decided to take a shot at building something that would feel closer to that.

Agenda is **specifically built for my own use**, and while I'd be honoured if anyone else found it useful, do not expect solid support. This was really just a quarantine project.

Agenda has:
* lists for every day of the week
* easy drag and drop for moving items between days or reordering items within one day
* a tiny rich-text editor for adding inline styles
* a mini-calendar for easy navigation
* absolutely no support for displays smaller than my laptop or any type of exporting or saving your data (expect from copy-pasting from local storage, I guess)
